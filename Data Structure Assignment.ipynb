    "1) Ordered:- Lists maintain the order of elements as they are inserted. The first element added will be at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.\n",
    "2) Mutable:- Lists can be modified after creation. We can add, remove, or change elements within a list.\n",
    "3) Dynamic:- Lists can grow or shrink in size as needed. we can add or remove elements without having to predefine the lists capacity\n",
    "4) Iterable:- You can iterate over the elements of a list using loops like for or list comprehensions.\n",
    "5) Nestable:- Lists can contain other lists as elements, creating nested structures. This allows for representing complex data hierarchies.\n",
